I am a Ph.D. student in Dr. Roberto Peverati's [group](peverati.github.io) at Florida Institute of Technology ([Florida Tech](fit.edu)). 

I earned a Bachelor's and a Master's degrees in Chemistry at the University of Turin (Italy), working under the supervision of [Dr. Giovanni Ghigo](https://www.chemistry.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?giovanni.ghigo#tab-profilo). During my college years in Turin, I also attended the local [Conservatory](http://conservatoriotorino.gov.it/), where I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Classical Saxophone under the guidance of Prof. Pietro Marchetti. 

When I am not doing chemistry, I am cooking, playing the saxophone, going out for walks, playing with my dog, building with Lego and reading. Not necessarily in this order.
