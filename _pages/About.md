I am currently a post-doctoral researcher in Prof. Jochen Autschbach's [group](https://ja01.chem.buffalo.edu/index.html) at the University at Buffalo ([SUNY at Buffalo](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/chemistry.html)). 

I earned my Ph.D. with Dr. Roberto Peverati (link to the group [webpage](https://peverati.github.io)) at Florida Institute of Technology ([Florida Tech](https://fit.edu)). 

I earned a Bachelor's and a Master's degrees in Chemistry at the University of Turin (Italy), working under the supervision of [Dr. Giovanni Ghigo](https://www.chemistry.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?giovanni.ghigo#tab-profilo). During my college years in Turin, I also attended the local [Conservatory](http://conservatoriotorino.gov.it/), where I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Classical Saxophone under the guidance of Prof. Pietro Marchetti. 

When I am not doing chemistry, I am cooking, playing the saxophone, going out for walks, playing with my dog, building with Lego and reading. Not necessarily in this order.
