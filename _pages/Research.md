## Theoretical and computational chemistry.

During my years at the university of Turin, I focused my attention on the elucidation of a few mechanisms of organic reactions using density functional theory (DFT). I studied the copper catalyzed cross-cupling reaction between different nucleophiles and N-phenyltetrahydroisoquinoline, which later resulted in [this](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpca.9b00324) publication. During my Master's, I worked on understanding the stereoselectivity of the [alkylation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004040391631200X) of cyclic silyl enol ethers. 

During my Ph.D., I worked on developing new databases for DFT. I started by collecting many databases of chemical data in a large collection called [ACCDB](https://github.com/peverati/ACCDB), which later became a *smaller* collection of databases, a.k.a. [ASCDB](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2019/cp/c9cp03211h). 

I also focused my attention towards applying DFT to solve problems in chemistry and catalysis. In our most recent collaboration with Dr. Nasri Nesnasâ€™ [group](http://research.fit.edu/nesnas) at Florida Tech, I investigated the mechanism of the light-driven uncaging of MDNI-L-glutamate and MDNI-Acetate with ground-state DFT and time-dependent-DFT (TD-DFT) unravelling information of capital importance for the synthesis of new molecules. It can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79701-4).

For my post-doctoral work, I am focusing my attention towards the computational investigation of vibrational optical activity.

## Chemical education.

I am interested in teaching about density functional theory through real life applications to experienced users and beginners alike. In this direction, Dr. Peverati and I put together a concise guide to DFT calculations called "The Devil in the Details", which you can read (for free!) [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/qua.26332). If you are interested and you want to learn more, feel free to reach out to me :)
